Chelsea takes its name from the estate and Georgian-style house of retired British Major Thomas 
Clarke. Clarke chose the name "Chelsea" after the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a retirement home for
soldiers in London, England.

<!--who obtained the property when he bought the farm of Jacob Somerindyck on August 16, 1750. 
The land was bounded by what would become 21st and 24th Streets, from the Hudson River to Eighth 
Avenue.[3] [10][11] Clarke passed the estate on to his daughter, Charity, who, 
with her husband Benjamin Moore, added land on the south of the estate, extending it to 19th Street.
[3] The house was the birthplace of their son, Clement Clarke Moore, who in turn inherited the 
property. Moore is generally credited with writing "A Visit From St. Nicholas" and was the author of
the first Greek and Hebrew lexicons printed in the United States.

In 1827, Moore gave the land of his apple orchard to the Episcopal Diocese of New York for the 
General Theological Seminary, which built its brownstone Gothic, tree-shaded campus south of the
manor house. Despite his objections to the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which ran the new Ninth 
Avenue through the middle of his estate, Moore began the development of Chelsea with the help of 
James N. Wells, dividing it up into lots along Ninth Avenue and selling them to well-heeled 
New Yorkers.[12] Covenants in the deeds of sale specified what could be built on the land – 
stables, manufacturing and commercial uses were forbidden – as well as architectural details 
of the buildings.[3]-->

<!--Chelsea is one of the oldest neighborhoods in New York City to keep its original name. Back in 
1750, an entrepreneurial Englishman named Thomas Clarke bought a “ten-square-block span” of land 
near the water in New York, and named the estate ‘Chelsea’ “after a soldier’s home near London” 
(Williams). The original Chelsea stretched between 8th and 10th Avenues, and 19th and 24th Streets
(Williams). Although Clarke bought the initial chunk of land and entitled it Chelsea, he is not
said to have been the official founder; his grandson, Clement Clarke Moore – the writer of The
Night Before Christmas – who divided the original estate in the 1830s is considered to be instead.
After this division, Chelsea really began to develop and grow.

In 1884, the famous Hotel Chelsea – “a place built beautifully, designed to bridge class divisions
and to value the arts” – opened on 23rd Street in the area, which was then New York City’s theatre 
district (Kellogg). This is when Chelsea’s artistic nature began, which continues to this day. 
The modern neighborhood is known for its numerous galleries, museums, and the High Line – a former
railroad transformed into an elevated, mile-long, public park featuring many works of art. Chelsea
has expanded to five or six times its original size over approximately a 200-year span and has 
been up-scaled by waves of gentrification.-->

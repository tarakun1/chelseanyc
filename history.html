    <title>Chelsea Now!</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Today, Chelsea is characterized as one of the most eclectic neighborhoods in New York City, but it 
has not always been that way. An example is how it started as an estate of 10 blocks, and now the 
total area of the neighborhood is approximated as 0.774 square miles – depending on which borders
one uses.</p> 

<p>Chelsea takes its name from the estate and Georgian-style house of retired British Major Thomas 
Clarke, who bought the property in 1750. He chose the name "Chelsea" after the Royal Hospital 
Chelsea, a retirement home for soldiers in London, England. The original Chelsea stretched between 
8th and 10th Avenues, and 19th and 24th Streets. His grandson, Clement Clarke Moore divided the original estate in the 1830s. After this division,
Chelsea really began to develop and grow.</p>

<p>Like most New York City neighborhoods, Chelsea has transformed throughout the years 
depending on those residing in its townhouses and apartment buildings. When Clement Clarke Moore 
was the property owner of much of Chelsea, the laying of the Hudson River Railroad tracks in 1847
that ran along Tenth Avenue greatly impacted the neighborhood. The neighborhood became filled with
warehouses, lumberyards, and industry. Then, in 1869 the world’s first elevated train was erected, running from Battery Park, up 9th 
Avenue (recently transformed into the <a href="https://www.thehighline.org/visit/" target="_blank">High Line</a>). In 1884, the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Chelsea" target="_blank">Hotel 
Chelsea</a> opened on 23rd Street in the area, which was then New York City’s theatre district. This is 
when Chelsea’s artistic nature began, which continues to this day.</p>

<!--who obtained the property when he bought the farm of Jacob Somerindyck on August 16, 1750. 
The land was bounded by what would become 21st and 24th Streets, from the Hudson River to Eighth 
Avenue.[3] [10][11] Clarke passed the estate on to his daughter, Charity, who, 
with her husband Benjamin Moore, added land on the south of the estate, extending it to 19th Street.
[3] The house was the birthplace of their son, Clement Clarke Moore, who in turn inherited the 
property. Moore is generally credited with writing "A Visit From St. Nicholas" and was the author of
the first Greek and Hebrew lexicons printed in the United States.

In 1827, Moore gave the land of his apple orchard to the Episcopal Diocese of New York for the 
General Theological Seminary, which built its brownstone Gothic, tree-shaded campus south of the
manor house. Despite his objections to the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which ran the new Ninth 
Avenue through the middle of his estate, Moore began the development of Chelsea with the help of 
James N. Wells, dividing it up into lots along Ninth Avenue and selling them to well-heeled 
New Yorkers.[12] Covenants in the deeds of sale specified what could be built on the land – 
stables, manufacturing and commercial uses were forbidden – as well as architectural details 
of the buildings.[3]-->

<!--Chelsea is one of the oldest neighborhoods in New York City to keep its original name. Back in 
1750, an entrepreneurial Englishman named Thomas Clarke bought a “ten-square-block span” of land 
near the water in New York, and named the estate ‘Chelsea’ “after a soldier’s home near London” 
(Williams). -->

 <!--Although 
Clarke bought the initial chunk of land and entitled it Chelsea, he is not
said to have been the official founder; his grandson, Clement Clarke Moore – the writer of The
Night Before Christmas – -->



For much of the period from 1869 to 1969, Chelsea would be home to industrialization and affordable housing. After the 
Greenwich Village’s Stonewall Inn raid of 1969, Chelsea would greatly change. Gay riots began throughout New York City, 
and “after finding few places affordable in Greenwich Village, gays and lesbians, were more than welcomed in Chelsea” 
(Salkaln). This was one of the events that began the neighborhood’s gentrification. 
</p>

<p>The modern neighborhood is known for its numerous galleries, museums, and the 
<a href="https://www.thehighline.org/visit/" target="_blank">High Line</a>, a former railroad transformed into an 
elevated, mile-long, public park featuring many works of art. Chelsea has expanded to five or six times its original size 
over approximately a 200-year span and has been up-scaled by waves of gentrification.</p>

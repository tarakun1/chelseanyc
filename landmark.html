        <h2>CHELSEA MARKET</h2>   
        <p> A block long and a block wide and just a short walk from the Hudson
        River in the area of Manhattan known as the Meatpacking District, 
        Chelsea Market has become in just fifteen years one of the greatest 
        indoor food halls of the world, with more than thirty-five vendors 
        purveying everything from soup to nuts, wine to coffee, cheese to 
        cheesecake. 
        Attracting 6 million national and international visitors annually, 
        it is one of the most trafficked, and written-about, destinations of 
        any kind in New York City. Chelsea Market is a neighborhood market 
        with a global perspective.

        <h2>THE HIGH LINE</h2>    
        <p>The High Line is a public park built on a historic freight rail line
        elevated above the streets on Manhattan’s West Side. 
        Saved from demolition by neighborhood residents and the City of 
        New York, the High Line opened in 2009 as a hybrid public space
        where visitors experience nature, art, and design. The High Line's 
        success has inspired cities throughout the United States to redevelop 
        obsolete infrastructure as public space.

         <h2>GRAND OPERA HOUSE</h2>   
        <p>Pike's Opera House, later renamed the Grand Opera House, was a 
        theater constructed in 1868, at a cost of a million dollars, for 
        distiller and entrepreneur Samuel N. Pike (1822–1872) of Cincinnati. 
        The building survived in altered form until 1960 as an RKO movie theater
        , after which it was replaced by part of Penn South, an urban renewal 
        housing development.
        Pike's Opera House was built on what had been the property of Clement 
        Clarke Moore, whose home, "Chelsea", has given its name to the 
        neighborhood.

        <h2>HOTEL CHELSEA</h2>    
        <p>A block long and a block wide and just a short walk from the Hudson 
        River in the area of Manhattan known as the Meatpacking District, 
        Chelsea Market has become in just fifteen years one of the greatest 
        indoor food halls of the world, with more than thirty-five vendors

        it is one of the most trafficked, and written-about, destinations of 
        any kind in New York City. 
        Chelsea Market is a neighborhood market with a global perspective.
        The 250-unit hotel has been the home of numerous writers, musicians,
        artists and actors. Though the Chelsea no longer accepts new long-term 
        residencies, the building is still home to many who lived 
        there before the change in policy.

         <h2>HELL’S KITCHEN</h2>   
        <p> Several legends compete to explain how Hell’s Kitchen got its name,
        but there’s no dispute about why.It’s now known by many for its 
        Off Broadway theaters, chic restaurants and luxury condominium 
        towers (and as the name of a reality TV show), Hell’s Kitchen has a
        history that’s rich with gangsters and ghosts, streetwalkers and
        speakeasies, mysterious disappearances and gruesome murders.

        <p> A block long and a block wide and just a short walk from the Hudson River in the area of Manhattan known as the Meatpacking District, Chelsea Market has become in just fifteen years one of the greatest indoor food halls of the world, with more than thirty-five vendors purveying everything from soup to nuts, wine to coffee, cheese to cheesecake. 
        Attracting 6 million national and international visitors annually, it is one of the most trafficked, and written-about, destinations of any kind in New York City. 
        Chelsea Market is a neighborhood market with a global perspective.

        <p>The High Line is a public park built on a historic freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattan’s West Side. 
        Saved from demolition by neighborhood residents and the City of New York, the High Line opened in 2009 as a hybrid public space where visitors experience nature, art, and design. 
        The High Line's success has inspired cities throughout the United States to redevelop obsolete infrastructure as public space. <br>

        <img class="operahouse-img" src="images/landmark images/operahouse-one.jpg" alt="Opera House Image">
        <p>Pike's Opera House, later renamed the Grand Opera House, was a theater constructed in 1868, at a cost of a million dollars, for distiller and entrepreneur Samuel N. Pike (1822–1872) of Cincinnati. 
        The building survived in altered form until 1960 as an RKO movie theater, after which it was replaced by part of Penn South, an urban renewal housing development.
        Pike's Opera House was built on what had been the property of Clement Clarke Moore, whose home, "Chelsea", has given its name to the neighborhood. <br>

        The 250-unit hotel has been the home of numerous writers, musicians, artists and actors. 
        Though the Chelsea no longer accepts new long-term residencies, the building is still home to many who lived there before the change in policy. <br>

        <p> Several legends compete to explain how Hell’s Kitchen got its name, but there’s no dispute about why.
        It’s now known by many for its Off Broadway theaters, chic restaurants and luxury condominium towers (and as the name of a reality TV show), Hell’s Kitchen has a history that’s rich with gangsters and ghosts, streetwalkers and speakeasies, mysterious disappearances and gruesome murders.<br>

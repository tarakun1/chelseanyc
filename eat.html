<p>Don’t be deterred by the lack of seating in this street-style taqueria--Los Tacos No. 1 is a must-eat in bustling Chelsea Market. The menu offers tacos, tostadas, mulas, and quesadillas with either steak, chicken, pork, or cactus and is made to order with flour or corn tortillas. But don’t be deceived by this simple menu--Los Tacos No. 1’s name speaks for itself. </p>
